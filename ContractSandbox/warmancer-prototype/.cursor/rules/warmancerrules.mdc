Warmancer is a variant of stratego running on the Stellar blockchain with simultaneous turn resolution using commit reveal logic.

"commit" means to send a salted hash for an object to the contract to be stored and "proof" or "prove" means to recieve the object and check the hash against the committed hash for equality

"user" and "opponent", often abbreviated to u_ or o_ suffixes, are words referring to the invoker of the method, not guest and host. guest and host is converted to user and opponent using get_player_index and get_opponent_index helper functions.

rules for valid moves:
* pawn must be owned by user
* pawn must be alive
* move pos must be a tile that is passable
* move pos must not be occupied by a pawn of the same team
